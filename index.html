            An ophthalmoscope is a medical instrument that works by allowing healthcare professionals to examine the internal structures of the eye, 
            such as the retina, optic disc, and blood vessels. 
            The device is typically handheld and consists of a light source, lens system, and adjustable aperture. 
            It allows healthcare professionals to detect a wide range of eye conditions, such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. 
            It can also be used to monitor the progression of these conditions and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.

            During an ophthalmoscopic exam, the healthcare professional will typically ask the patient to sit in a darkened room and look straight ahead. 
            The healthcare professional will then hold the ophthalmoscope up to the patient's eye and shine a beam of light into the eye. 
            The adjustable aperture on the device allows the healthcare professional to adjust the level of illumination and magnification, 
            allowing for a clearer view of the internal structures of the eye.
            The healthcare professional will then use the lens system to examine the retina, optic disc, and blood vessels in the eye. 
            They may also use additional lenses to get a closer look at specific areas of the eye. During the exam, 
            the healthcare professional may ask the patient to look in different directions or to focus on different objects in order to get a more complete view of the eye.

            <h3>Types of Opthalmoscope</h3>
            <p class="type-para">There are different types of ophthalmoscopy</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Direct ophthalmoscopy.</strong>
                        You will be seated in a darkened room. The health care provider performs this 
                        exam by shining a beam of light through the pupil using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. An ophthalmoscope is about the size of a flashlight. 
                        It has a light and different tiny lenses that allow the provider to view the back of the eyeball.</li>
                    <li><strong>Indirect ophthalmoscopy.</strong> 
                        You will either lie or sit in a semi-reclined position. The provider holds your eye open while shining a very bright 
                        light into the eye using an instrument worn on the head. (The instrument looks like a miner's light.) The provider views 
                        the back of the eye through a lens held close to your eye. Some pressure may be applied to the eye using a small, 
                        blunt probe. You will be asked to look in various directions. This exam is usually used to look for a detached retina.</li>
                    <li><strong> Slitlamp ophthalmoscopy.</strong>
                        You will sit in a chair with the instrument placed in front of you. 
                        You will be asked to rest your chin and forehead on a support to keep your head steady. 
                        The provider will use the microscope part of the slit lamp and a tiny lens placed close to the front of the eye. 
                        The provider can see about the same with this technique as with indirect ophthalmoscopy, but with higher magnification.</li>
                </ol>
